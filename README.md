# chrome-service-backend
Source code repository for chrome backend

# Requirements
Postgres 14
Go 1.18 

## Local Testing

1. There are environment variables that are necessary for the application to start. Please copy the contents within `env.example` and move them over to a new `.env` file at the root of your local app directory. There, set the values of the variables accordingly for your local db configuration. This repo also supports `docker-compose up` for its postgres server and `make infra` to run all needed containers. An example `.env` for this would look like:
```
PGSQL_USER=chrome
PGSQL_PASSWORD=chrome
PGSQL_HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0
PGSQL_PORT=5432
PGSQL_DATABASE=postgres
```
2. Run the server by using `go run .` or `go run main.go`
3. To test the service, at the moment, you are able to hit the following endpoint:
```
GET http://localhost:8000/health
GET http://localhost:8000/api/chrome/v1/hello-world
```

### Headers

To query any endpoint, you will need a `x-rh-identity` header in your request.

You can use this value as an example:

```
eyJpZGVudGl0eSI6eyJ1c2VyIjp7InVzZXJfaWQiOiIxMiJ9fX0=
```

### Helpful Make targets

`make database` will start a podman database, you need to fill out the `.env` file first as detailed above. 

`make clean` will tear down the database.

`make dev` run the service

`make infra` will create the db and kafka locally
